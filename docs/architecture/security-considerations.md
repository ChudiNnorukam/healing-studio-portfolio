# Security Considerations

## Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (client, admin, therapist)
- Session management with Redis
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

## Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive content
- GDPR compliance for user data
- Regular security audits
- Secure file upload handling

## Privacy
- Anonymous analytics where possible
- User consent management
- Data retention policies
- Secure deletion procedures
