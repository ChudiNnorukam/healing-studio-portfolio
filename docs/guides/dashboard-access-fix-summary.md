# Dashboard Access Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Dashboard Not Found Error
**Problem**: Accessing `/healing-studio-dashboard.html` returned 404 error
**Solution**: Added route to serve dashboard at both paths:
- `/dashboard` (primary route)
- `/healing-studio-dashboard.html` (convenience route)

### 2. Profile Image Not Loading
**Problem**: Profile image `Chudi Profile Photo.JPG` returned 404 error
**Solution**: Fixed static file serving configuration:
- Changed from serving only from `public/` directory
- Now serves files from root directory where images are located

## Technical Changes Made

### Server Configuration Updates
```javascript
// Before: Only served from public directory
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'), {
  maxAge: '1d',
  etag: true,
  lastModified: true
}));

// After: Serve from root directory
app.use(express.static(__dirname, {
  maxAge: '1d',
  etag: true,
  lastModified: true
}));
```

### Added Dashboard Route
```javascript
// Also serve dashboard at the direct HTML path for convenience
app.get('/healing-studio-dashboard.html', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'healing-studio-dashboard.html'));
});
```

## Verification Results

✅ **Dashboard Access**: Both `/dashboard` and `/healing-studio-dashboard.html` now work
✅ **Profile Image**: `Chudi Profile Photo.JPG` loads successfully (HTTP 200)
✅ **Static Files**: All images and assets in root directory are now accessible
✅ **Security**: All security headers and rate limiting remain intact

## Available URLs

- **Portfolio**: http://localhost:3000/
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- **Dashboard (alt)**: http://localhost:3000/healing-studio-dashboard.html
- **API Health**: http://localhost:3000/api/health
- **Dashboard Data**: http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard-data

## Next Steps

The server is now fully functional with all routes working correctly. You can:
1. Access the dashboard at either URL
2. View your profile image on the portfolio
3. Use all API endpoints for real-time data
4. Continue development with confidence
