## Bug #1: Memory Leak in Dashboard Chart Initialization (Performance Issue)

### **Location**: `src/js/dashboard.js` (lines 103-113)

### **Bug Description**:
The dashboard creates Chart.js instances but has a critical memory leak where charts are not properly destroyed when re-initializing or switching tabs. The `initializeCharts()` method creates new chart instances without checking if existing charts need to be destroyed first.

### **Root Cause**:
```javascript
async initializeCharts() {
    try {
        await this.createProgressChart();
        await this.createAgentActivityChart();
        await this.createMetricsChart();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to initialize charts:', error);
    }
}
```

The method doesn't clear existing charts before creating new ones, leading to:
- Memory leaks as old Chart.js instances remain in memory
- Multiple event listeners accumulating
- Degraded performance over time
- Potential canvas context conflicts

### **Impact**:
- **Severity**: High
- **Performance**: Causes memory usage to grow continuously
- **User Experience**: Browser slowdown, especially on tab switching
- **Resource Usage**: Unnecessary DOM elements and event listeners

### **Fix Applied**:
✅ **COMPLETED** - Enhanced the chart initialization with proper cleanup and existing chart detection:

1. **Added `destroyExistingCharts()` method**: Properly destroys existing chart instances before creating new ones
2. **Enhanced error handling**: Wraps chart destruction in try-catch to prevent cascade failures  
3. **Memory management**: Clears the charts Map after destruction to release references
4. **Integration**: Modified `initializeCharts()` to call cleanup before chart creation

**Code Changes**:
- Added proper chart cleanup in `destroyExistingCharts()` method
- Modified `initializeCharts()` to clear existing charts first
- Added defensive error handling for chart destruction

## Bug #2: Insecure Static File Serving (Security Vulnerability)

### **Location**: `assets/scripts/server.js` (lines 66-71)

### **Bug Description**:
The Express.js server serves static files from the current directory (`__dirname`) without proper path validation, creating a potential directory traversal vulnerability.

### **Root Cause**:
```javascript
// Static file serving - serve files from root directory
app.use(express.static(__dirname, {
  maxAge: '1d',
  etag: true,
  lastModified: true
}));
```

This configuration:
- Serves files directly from the server script directory
- Lacks proper path sanitization
- Could potentially expose sensitive server files
- Doesn't restrict file types that can be served

### **Impact**:
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Security Risk**: Directory traversal attacks
- **Data Exposure**: Potential access to server configuration files
- **Compliance**: Violates security best practices

### **Fix Applied**:
✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented secure static file serving with proper path restrictions and file type validation:

1. **Secure path resolution**: Changed from serving `__dirname` to serving project root via `path.join(__dirname, '../../')`
2. **File type restrictions**: Added whitelist of allowed file extensions (.html, .css, .js, .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .svg, .ico, .json)
3. **Dotfile protection**: Added `dotfiles: 'deny'` to prevent serving hidden configuration files
4. **Security headers**: Added X-Content-Type-Options and X-Frame-Options headers to static responses
5. **Custom setHeaders function**: Validates file extensions and blocks unauthorized file types

**Code Changes**:
- Modified Express static middleware configuration
- Added file extension validation
- Implemented security headers for static files
- Enhanced path security

## Bug #3: Race Condition in Chart Library Loading (Logic Error)

### **Location**: `src/js/dashboard.js` (lines 38-54)

### **Bug Description**:
The Chart.js library loading uses dynamic imports but doesn't properly handle race conditions when multiple chart creation methods are called simultaneously. This can lead to charts being created before the library is fully loaded and registered.

### **Root Cause**:
```javascript
async loadChartLibrary() {
    try {
        // Dynamic import for better performance
        const { Chart, registerables } = await import('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.0/+esm');
        
        // Register all Chart.js components
        Chart.register(...registerables);
        
        this.chartLibrary = Chart;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to load Chart.js:', error);
        throw new Error('Chart library could not be loaded');
    }
}
```

Issues:
- No check if library is already loaded/loading
- Multiple simultaneous calls can cause conflicts
- No fallback mechanism for loading failures
- Chart creation methods don't verify library is ready

### **Impact**:
- **Severity**: Medium
- **User Experience**: Charts fail to render randomly
- **Error Rate**: Increases with multiple simultaneous chart operations
- **Reliability**: Inconsistent dashboard functionality

### **Fix Applied**:
✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented proper loading state management with singleton pattern and loading verification:

1. **Loading state tracking**: Added `chartLibraryLoading` property to track ongoing loading operations
2. **Singleton pattern**: Prevents multiple simultaneous Chart.js loading attempts
3. **Promise reuse**: Returns existing loading promise if library is already being loaded
4. **Early return**: Returns cached library if already loaded
5. **Library verification**: Added verification in chart creation methods to ensure library is loaded
6. **Error state cleanup**: Properly clears loading state on both success and failure

**Code Changes**:
- Added `chartLibraryLoading` state tracking property
- Refactored `loadChartLibrary()` with race condition prevention
- Created internal `_loadChartLibraryInternal()` method
- Added library verification in `createProgressChart()`, `createAgentActivityChart()`, and `createMetricsChart()`
- Enhanced error handling and state cleanup
