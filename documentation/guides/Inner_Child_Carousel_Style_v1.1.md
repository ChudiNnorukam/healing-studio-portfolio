## ⟡ Preface

Use this ritual not to fix yourself, but to witness who you’ve always been.  
This is a visual and emotional practice for reentering memory with gentleness, not urgency.

- Always pair text with one gentle **visual anchor**
- No logos, all-caps, or corporate styles
- Designed for emotional resonance — not information delivery
