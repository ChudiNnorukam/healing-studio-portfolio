## 🧠 Slide SEO Intelligence Layer

### Top Traits from High-Performing Pins:
| Trait | Why It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| Poetic, faceless quote on Slide 1 | Instantly stops scroll with emotion |
| Serif bold + childlike accent font | Sacred but accessible |
| Text rhythm = 2–4 lines | Breathable, not crowded |
| Minimal pastel background | Algorithm-optimized contrast |
| Alt text = visual + emotion | Helps search + accessibility |
| CTA = soft and embedded | Works best as final slide overlay or description text |

## 📌 Pinterest Optimization

- **Alt Text**: Soft pastel quote slide with inner child healing message and minimalist drawing
- **CTA Slide Text**: “See the full deck →” or “Get your own custom slide”
```

## 🧪 A/B Test Framework

| Element | Version A | Version B |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Pin Title | Poetic declarative | Soft question (e.g. “Do you feel this too?”) |
| Slide 1 | Quote-only | Quote + tiny icon |
| CTA (final slide) | No CTA | Overlay: “Get your own” or “See full deck →” |
| Description | Emotional + SEO | SEO first, then poetic soft sell |
