- Identified portfolio as a Single Page Application (SPA)

### 2. **Git Operations**

- All branches are now synchronized

### 3. **GitHub Pages SPA Fix Implementation**
- **Created `404.html`**: Added redirect script for SPA routing support
  - Implements GitHub Pages SPA solution from `rafgraph/spa-github-pages`
  - Handles deep linking and direct URL access
  - Set `pathSegmentsToKeep = 1` for project pages
  
- **Updated `index.html`**: Added SPA redirect handler script
  - Processes redirected URLs from 404.html
  - Restores correct URLs using `window.history.replaceState`
  - Maintains browser history for proper navigation

## 🔍 Current Status

### ✅ Successfully Implemented
- SPA routing support for GitHub Pages
- Proper 404 handling with redirects
- Clean commit history maintained
- All portfolio content preserved

### ⏳ Pending GitHub Pages Configuration
The site is still returning 404 errors, which indicates one of the following:

1. **GitHub Pages not enabled** - Repository settings need Pages enabled
2. **Source branch/folder not configured** - May need to set source to main branch
3. **Deployment delay** - GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to update
4. **Repository visibility** - May need to be public for Pages to work

## 🚀 Portfolio Features

### Main Site (`index.html`)
- Professional trauma healing content specialist portfolio

### Testing Suite

## 📝 Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **Verify GitHub Pages Settings**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Ensure source is set to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Save settings

2. **Check Repository Visibility**:
   - Ensure repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)

3. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Wait 10-15 minutes for full deployment
   - Check GitHub Actions tab for build status
