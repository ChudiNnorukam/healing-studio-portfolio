## Summary

**Scope of Access**: I have full access to your GitHub repository and can work with all files within it, but I cannot access your personal computer files or any data outside this specific repository workspace. I can test and modify the web page, run development servers, install dependencies, and perform comprehensive automated testing.

**Limitations**: My access is strictly limited to the repository workspace environment - I cannot reach beyond this sandbox to access your personal files, other repositories (unless specifically shared), or make any changes to your actual computer system.
